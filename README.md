# Liri
Liri Bot Assignment

This program was created in the Northwestern University Coding Bootcamp 2019. It is similar to a SIRI application on an iPhone. This program challenges the user to accomplish different terminal based commands using Node JS. The coder was also challenged to log all search results.


## LIRI Bot Functions

- spotify-this-song
- movie-this
- concert-this
- do-what-it-says

## What Each Function does

#### node liri.js spotify-this-song <user input song title>
* this will display up to 5 items with the artist's name, name of the song, link to preview the song, the album the song is on.

#### node liri.js concert-this <user input with artist name>
* This will display the name of the artist searchde, the venue's name/city of their next performance, other artists featured in the concert, the date of the performance, if tickets are still available, and the link on where to get tickets.
